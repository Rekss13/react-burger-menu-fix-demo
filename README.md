# Getting Started with Create React App

When running the react-burger-menu local demo, I ran into a lot of errors that prevented the code from running. These edits allowed the demo to run correctly.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
